          When an acid is dissolved in water we get an <span id="text-1">acidic</span> solution. When a base dissolves in
          water it is an alkali and makes an <span id="text-2">alkaline</span> solution. If a solution is neither
          acidic nor alkaline it is <span id="text-3">neutral</span>. Pure water is neutral, and so is
          paraffin.

          Indicators are substances that change colour when they are added to
          acidic or alkaline solutions. Litmus, phenolphthalein, and methyl
          orange are all indicators that are commonly used in the laboratory.

          Litmus indicator solution turns red in acidic solutions and blue in
          alkaline solutions - and it turns purple in neutral solutions.

          <span id="text-2">Litmus paper</span> is usually more reliable, and
          comes as red litmus paper and blue litmus paper. The table shows the
          colour changes it can make.
