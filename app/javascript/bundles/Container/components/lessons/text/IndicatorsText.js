    <p>
      When an acid is dissolved in water we get an <span id="text-1">acidic</span> solution. When a base dissolves in
      water it is an alkali and makes an <span id="text-2">alkaline</span> solution. If a solution is neither
      acidic nor alkaline it is <span id="text-3">neutral</span>. Pure water is neutral, and so is
      paraffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indicators are substances that change colour when they are added to
      acidic or alkaline solutions. Litmus, phenolphthalein, and methyl
      orange are all indicators that are commonly used in the laboratory.

      <span id="text-1">Litmus</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Litmus indicator solution turns red in acidic solutions and blue in
      alkaline solutions - and it turns purple in neutral solutions.

      <span id="text-2">Litmus paper</span> is usually more reliable, and
      comes as red litmus paper and blue litmus paper. The table shows the
      colour changes it can make.
